#  AppMate CLI v0.3.0

The **instant app launcher** for humans in a hurry.

No more config jungles. No more stale boilerplate. No more wasted hours.

##  What It Does

AppMate CLI launches a dev-ready app (React + Vite + Firebase) in seconds with:

-  Fully scaffolded project
-  Vite + React installed and preconfigured
-  Firebase-ready wiring
-  File structure set with Nova's opinionated defaults
-  One command: `node index.js` (or soon: `npx appmate`)

This is more than a tool. It's a ***vibe***. A Badass Vibe, just like you!
